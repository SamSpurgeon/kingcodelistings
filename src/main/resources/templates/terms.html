If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in Pounds Sterling, and we may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on the Helpisontheway website.

If you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your ability to use the services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. <br><br>You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from the Helpisontheway sites, services, applications or tools in case we believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee.

                     <h3 class="mg-md">Infringement<br></h3>
                     <p>Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright, design and trademark (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). A large number of products of all sorts are offered on Helpisontheway by private individuals in the UK. Entitled parties, in particular owners of copyright, trademark rights or other rights can report any advertisement which may infringe on their rights, and submit a request for such advertisement to be removed. If a legal representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the correct manner, products infringing on the intellectual property rights will be removed by Helpisontheway. <br><br>Reporting an infringement:<br>In order to participate in the Notice of Infringement Programme, you only need to complete a&nbsp;Notice of Infringement Form&nbsp;and fax it to Helpisontheway. You can use&nbsp;this form, complete with your signature, to report advertisements which may infringe on your property rights. The information requested in the Notice of Infringement Form is for the purpose of ensuring that the parties reporting these objects are either the entitled party or their officially authorized representative. This information must also enable Helpisontheway to identify the advertisement to be removed. Once we have received your correctly completed Notice of Infringement Form, you can simply send later reports to Helpisontheway via the e-mail address provided. <br><br>Note: This form can only be used by the lawful owners of the relevant intellectual property rights. The "Notice of Infringement" is intended to enable rights owners to ensure that products offered by Helpisontheway users do not infringe their copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights. For all other questions, visitors and advertisers can get help using&nbsp;Helpisontheway Help. <br> <br><br></p>
                     <h3 class="mg-md">Liability<br></h3>
                     <p>Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, or for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do. <br><br>We do not review users' postings and are not involved in the actual transactions between users. As most of the content on Helpisontheway comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what's offered. <br><br>In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law. <br><br>You acknowledge that we cannot guarantee continuous, error-free or secure access to our services or that defects in the service will be corrected. While we will use reasonable efforts to maintain an uninterrupted service, we cannot guarantee this and we do not give any promises or warranties (whether express or implied) about the operation and availability of our sites, services, applications or tools. <br><br>Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted we expressly disclaim all warranties, representations and conditions, express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose and those arising by statute. We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of, or inability to use Helpisontheway, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 Pounds Sterling. <br> <br><br></p>

                     <h3 class="mg-md">Third party rights<br></h3>
                     <p>A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this User Agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party specified in this Agreement or which exists or is available apart from that Act. <br> <br><br></p>

                     <h3 class="mg-md">Resolution of disputes<br></h3>
                     <p>If a dispute arises between you and Helpisontheway, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by going to the Helpisontheway Help page. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. <br> <br><br></p>
                     <h3 class="mg-md">Mobile Devices Terms<br></h3>
                     <p>If you're accessing Helpisontheway Services from a mobile device using a Helpisontheway Mobile Application (the "Application"), the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") apply to you in addition to the applicable Mobile Privacy and Legal Notice or End User License Agreement, as the case may be. Your use of the Application confirms your agreement to these Terms of Use. <br><br><strong>Application</strong> <strong>Use</strong>.&nbsp;Helpisontheway grants you the right to use the Application only for your personal use. You must comply with all applicable laws and third party terms of agreement when using the Application (e.g. your wireless data service agreement). The Application may not contain the same functionality available on the www.Helpisontheway.com website. Your download and use of the Application is at your own discretion and risk, and you are solely responsible for any damages to your hardware device(s) or loss of data that results from the download or use of the Application. <br><br><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> - Applications.&nbsp;Helpisontheway owns, or is the licensee to, all right, title, and interest in and to its Applications, including all rights under patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and any and all other proprietary rights, including all applications, renewals, extensions, and restorations thereof. You will not modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from any Application and you will not remove, obscure, or alter Helpisontheway's copyright notice, trademarks or other proprietary rights notices affixed to, contained within, or accessed in conjunction with or by any Helpisontheway Application. <br><br><strong>Prohibited Countries Policy and Foreign Trade Regulation</strong> - Applications.&nbsp;Helpisontheway Applications or their underlying technology may not be downloaded to or exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a resident or national of) Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or any other country subject to United States embargo; (b) to anyone on the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or on the US Commerce Department's Denied Party or Entity List; and (c) to any prohibited country, person, end-user, or entity specified by US Export Laws. When using an Kijiji Application, you are responsible for complying with trade regulations and both foreign and domestic laws (e.g., you are not located in a country that is subject to a US Government embargo, or that has been designated by the US Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and you are not listed on any US Government list of prohibited or restricted parties). <br><br>Additional Terms.&nbsp;Additional terms and conditions that apply to you based on the mobile device the Application is installed on: <br> <br><strong>iOS - Apple:</strong> <br>1. These Terms of Use are an agreement between you and Helpisontheway, and not with Apple. Apple is not responsible for the Application and the content thereof.<br>2. Helpisontheway grants you the right to use the Application only on an iOS product that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service.<br>3. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application.<br>4. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third party intellectual property infringement claim.<br>5. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Application or your possession and/or use of the Application, including but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.<br>6. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if applicable, for the Application to you; and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application.<br>7. Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use, and, upon your acceptance, Apple as a third party beneficiary thereof will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Use against you.<br> <br><strong>Windows - Microsoft</strong><br>1. These Terms of Use are an agreement between you and Helpisontheway, not Microsoft. The terms of use and privacy policies of Microsoft and, where applicable, the network operators that provide billing services for the Windows Phone Marketplace do not apply to your use of the Application.<br>2. You may install and use one (1) copy of the Application on up to five (5) devices you personally own or control and which are affiliated with the Windows Live ID associated with your Windows Marketplace account. You may not install or use a copy of the Application on a device you do not own or control.<br>3. Microsoft, your device manufacturer, and (if applicable) your wireless carrier are not responsible for providing support services for the Application.<br>4. Microsoft, the wireless carriers over whose network the Application is distributed (if applicable), and each of their respective affiliates and suppliers (collectively, "Disclaiming Distributors") give no express warranty, guarantee, or conditions under or in relation to the Application. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the Disclaiming Distributors exclude any implied warranties or conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.<br>5. You, and not the Disclaiming Distributors, bear the risk of using the Application (even if the Disclaiming Distributors have been advised of the possibility of damages to you). You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which these Terms of Use cannot change.<br>6. To the extent not prohibited by law, you will not seek to recover any consequential, lost profit, special, indirect, or incidental damages from any Disclaiming Distributor. <br> <br><br></p>
